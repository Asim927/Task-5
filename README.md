# Task-5
This project builds a Logistic Regression model to predict heart disease (target column `target`, where 0 means no disease and 1 means disease) using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset. The steps include loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, selecting feature columns as `X` and `target` as `y`, performing a train–test split (for example, 80% training and 20% testing) to train the model on one part of the data and evaluate it on unseen data, training `LogisticRegression` on the training set, making predictions on the test set, and calculating evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. A confusion matrix is also generated to observe true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, helping to understand the types of prediction errors. Key concepts used are train–test split (to avoid overfitting and check generalization), overfitting (when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data), accuracy (overall correct predictions), precision (how many predicted positives are actually positive), recall (how many actual positives are correctly identified), and the confusion matrix as a compact summary of classification performance.
